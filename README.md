I am a software developer with a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from the University of Leicester and a graduate of the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. 

I have been an open-source developer for the Anti Malware Alliance since since May 2024, and authored and actively maintain [DocuBleach](https://pypi.org/project/docubleach/), a PyPi-published Python-based cybersecurity tool that detects and purges macros from modern and legacy office files.

I have experience with Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C#, and have created web applications, APIs, desktop applications, and databases as part of personal projects, open-source work, and formal education.

**Open to Junior Developer roles and open-source projects.**
