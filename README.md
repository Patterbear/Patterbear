I am a Security Engineer at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.co.uk/), based in the United Kingdom.

I'm also an open-source developer for the [Anti Malware Alliance](https://anti-malware-alliance.org/) since May 2024, and the author and maintainer of [DocuBleach](https://pypi.org/project/docubleach/).

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk) with First-Class Honours and have completed the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) Software Development and the [CodeVerse](https://www.codeverse.co.uk/) Python Engineering Bootcamps.

I am experienced with Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C#, and have created web applications, APIs, mobile applications, databases, and desktop applications as part of personal projects, open-source work, and formal education.

**Always open to open-source projects.**
